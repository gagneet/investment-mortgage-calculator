# Variable Rate Mortgage Calculator - Complete Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to set up and run the full-featured Variable Rate Mortgage Calculator with yearly investment projections.

## Project Structure

The project consists of these key files:

- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `src/App.js` - The main application component
- `src/index.js` - Entry point for the React app
- `src/index.css` - CSS styles with Tailwind CSS setup
- `tailwind.config.js` - Configuration for Tailwind CSS
- `public/index.html` - HTML template
- `public/manifest.json` - Web app manifest
- `public/robots.txt` - Robots file

## Complete Setup Steps

1. **Create a new project folder**

```
mkdir mortgage-calculator
cd mortgage-calculator
```

2. **Create the folder structure**

```bash
mkdir -p src public
```

3. **Add all files to their proper locations**

   - Copy package.json to the root directory
   - Copy App.js to the src directory
   - Copy index.js and index.css to the src directory
   - Copy tailwind.config.js to the root directory
   - Copy index.html to the public directory
   - Copy manifest.json to the public directory
   - Copy robots.txt to the public directory

4. **Create placeholder favicon and logo files**

   You can either:
   - Copy these from a standard React app, or
   - Create empty files:

```bash
touch public/favicon.ico
touch public/logo192.png
touch public/logo512.png
```

5. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

6. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Alternative Setup: Using Create React App

If you prefer, you can use Create React App and then replace specific files:

1. **Initialize a new React app**

```bash
npx create-react-app mortgage-calculator
cd mortgage-calculator
```

2. **Replace key files with our custom versions**

   - Replace `package.json` with our version
   - Replace `src/App.js` with our mortgage calculator code
   - Replace `src/index.js` and `src/index.css` with our versions
   - Add `tailwind.config.js` to the root directory

3. **Install any additional dependencies**

```bash
npm install recharts tailwindcss
```

4. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a blank page:

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Try using the simplified version of App.js if needed
4. Make sure the public directory has all required files

If you're missing image files referenced in manifest.json, either:

- Create empty placeholder files
- Remove those references from manifest.json
- Copy these files from another React project
